Programs to plot data from two-dimensional simulations. In detail the 
properties are:

  conew.pro
    Main routines (and most advanced so far) to plot 2D data. Input is
    unformatted. Routine generates contour plots, arrow plots for 
    vector fields and surface plots. arrow and contour plots can be 
    overlayed. Program makes use of subroutine VECT.PRO in 
    ~/idl_lib/routines.
  con.pro
    Version used for KH. Similar to conew, no identifcation of sim vs plot 
          
    coordinates
  conkh.pro
    Version used for KH. vz_sim,bz_sim etc.
  conio.pro
    for ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling.
  conrek.pro
    Same as conew but plots separatrix better (if x line at boundary).
  conres.pro
    Same as conew but plot resistivity in addition.
  cotail.pro
    Some version for tail geometry.
  conf.pro
    Old version of conew. Major difference is the formatted read.
  prof.pro
    Generates cuts through multiple two-dimensional dataset to 
    illustrate the evolution of particular properties


  coldon.pro 
   Program to plot kh simulation results (collaboration with Don
   Fairfield) for rotated coordinates sim(x,y) -> plot(y,-x) +
   rotation of the simulation (y,z) coordinates by an angle alpha.
  msprek.pro
   Similar to coldon but different routine vecpot1
   to compute the vectorpotential and default angle alpha=0.
  mspkh.pro
   Similar to msprek.pro but without the change sim(x,y) -> plot(y,-x).
   Are vector components like By, Bz correct? Different routine vecpot1
   to compute the vectorpotential.
  colrek.pro
  Various changes compared to coldon: 
   sim(x,y) -> plot(x,-z) which requires to plot x pointing to the
   right. Change in no and type of plots. No plot of the projection
   of the magnetic field bz and velocity vz back to msp coordinates.
