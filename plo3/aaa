This directory contains programs for plotting three-dimensional data.
In detail the contents is:

 byy3.pro
   hodogram plot??

 col3new appears to be the most recent ploting routine



 cut3.pro
 cut3arc.pro
   Plotting routines for plotting 3D data. Contain contour, surface 
   
   repsentations for scalar fields and arrow plots for vector fields.
   data is read from unformatted. cut3d uses orginal geometry of the 

   input data; cut3arc exchanges y and z directions for ionospheric 
   geometry. Attention when dealing with prseudovectors like current 
   or electric field vector. The routine ought to be tested for proper
   operation. Problems also arise with postscript device. 
 plotvol.pro
   Routine for three-dimensional represention of volume data. 

   Input is unformatted. plotvol
   makes use of the idl program SLICER or the programs SLOWN (derived
   from slicer (with the possibility of postscript output) or PLOT3D
   (with the possibilities of postsript and animation. Subroutines
   reside in ~/idl_lib/routines.   
 pot.pro
 potarc.pro
   Routine for for plotting the output of pot.f, a fortran programm
   which determines the field aligned electric potential difference 
   for field lines which originate from a rectangular grid in the
   simulation box. Input is formatted. structure is otherwise close to 
   cut3.
 div
   defcol.dl
     hints for color table definitions for postscript output
   demo3d.pro
     demonstrates and test routines used for three-dimensional data
     display. 
   f2b.f
   rin
   velovect.pro


 d3.pro and d33.pro - last 3d plot routines used for magnetotail simulations
